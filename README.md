Sign language recognition using leap motion controller using decision tree model. This hack is made during #AUHack2017

After hours of brainstorming, to be exact 16h, our team decided to use Leap motion to build a library for recognition of sign language alphabet.
We started with a short research we did not found an open source library for recognition of sign alphabet. Next step was trying to find if it is feasible. We stumble on this paper(http://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2015/PDP7080.pdf). We implemented the idea of using decimation tree described in the paper. If there is a future development it can use machine learning instead of decision tree. We are close to the paper KPI %.
We build an UI for learning sign language using Leap motion. There are many other potential usedcases for this library.
