Sign language alphabet intepreter.

This is a JavaScript framework that uses the Libmotion camera to interpret hand signs into sign language alphabet.The project was developed as our team's entry for the [#AUHack2017](https://auhack.org/) event. The framework uses the raw data provided by the camera and inteprets the vector data into specific conditions that need to be fullfilled to obtain a specific letter.

For determining the letter simbol we have used the publication of Makiko Funasaka, Yu Ishikawa, Masami Takata, and Kazuki Joe [Sign Language Recognition using Leap Motion Controller](http://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2015/PDP7080.pdf). Our prliminary KPI mesurments are positive, with accuracy around 80% as discribed in the publication. 

To demonstrate the functionality the project has a simple Web UI that tests your ability to spel sign alphabet.
